Sync workspace files to a GitHub Gist with a single command.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-file sync**: Sync any files you configure
- **Per-project Gist**: Each workspace gets its own Gist
- **Manual trigger**: Sync via Command Palette or status bar
- **Zero config auth**: Uses VSCode's built-in GitHub authentication

## 📦 Installation

Install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prberg.gist-sync):

```
ext install prberg.gist-sync
```

Or search for "Gist Sync" in the Extensions view (`Cmd+Shift+X`).

## 🚀 Usage

1. Configure which files to sync in settings (defaults to `TODO.md`)
2. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and run **Gist Sync: Sync Files to Gist**
3. Authorize with GitHub when prompted (first sync only)
4. A new private Gist is created and linked to your workspace

The Gist ID is stored in `.vscode/settings.json` for future syncs.
